  <h2>Why I Admire Him</h2>
  <p>
    Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is one of the greatest leaders in Indian history. He was a visionary, a brilliant strategist, and a symbol of courage and self-respect. His commitment to Swarajya (self-rule) and justice has always inspired me deeply.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite the odds, Shivaji Maharaj established a competent and progressive civil rule with the help of a disciplined military and a well-structured administrative setup. He respected all religions and stood for the unity and welfare of his people.
  </p>

  <p>
    What I admire the most about him is his bravery, respect for women, sharp mind, and dedication to his motherland. He is a timeless symbol of leadership, valor, and wisdom.
  </p>

  <h2>Legacy</h2>
  <p>
    Shivaji Maharaj's legacy continues to inspire millions. Forts like Raigad, Pratapgad, and Sinhagad are living testimonies of his strength and vision. His ideas of governance and leadership are still relevant in today’s world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Remembering Shivaji Maharaj is not just about honoring a warrior but embracing values like integrity, unity, and fearlessness in our lives.
